# To-Do:

- I can store JSONs in a PostgreSQL database. So I can just put all reviews into a JSON file and put it as JSON field
- Everytime I call a row, I don't want to call ALL the reviews of a novel because data analysis pipeline is separate from the NLP pipeline. Maybe I can separate the two and link them somehow
